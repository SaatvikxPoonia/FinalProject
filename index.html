                <h2>Deep Link Resolution System</h2>
                <p>The deep link resolution system addresses critical attribution challenges in mobile marketing campaigns by creating a seamless connection between advertising campaigns and app content.</p>
                
                <h3>Problem Statement and Motivation</h3>
                <p>Traditional app attribution systems often fail to provide accurate tracking for advertising campaigns, leading to inefficient marketing spend and poor user experience. With over 2 crore unique ads in the system and initially only ~28,000 having valid deep links, there was a significant opportunity for improvement in attribution coverage.</p>
                
                <h3>Deferred Deep Link Architecture</h3>
                <p>The deferred deep link system implements a sophisticated matching algorithm that connects advertising campaigns with app content even when direct deep links are unavailable. The system uses content metadata, campaign parameters, and machine learning techniques to establish these connections probabilistically.</p>
                
                <h3>Google Ads API Integration</h3>
                <p>The integration with Google Ads API required careful handling of OAuth authentication, API rate limits, and bulk data processing. The system implements robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and monitoring to ensure reliable data synchronization. Campaign data is processed in batches using worker pools to optimize throughput while respecting API constraints.</p>

The system forwards attribution events, handles callback processing, and maintains attribution data consistency. Real-time event processing ensures timely attribution reporting for marketing optimization.</p>
                
                <h3>Content Matching Algorithms</h3>
                <p>The content matching system uses multiple signals including text similarity, category matching, geographic relevance, and temporal patterns to establish connections between ads and app content. Machine learning models are trained on historical successful matches to improve matching accuracy over time.</p>
                
                <h3>Performance and Scale Considerations</h3>
                <p>The system processes millions of attribution events daily, requiring efficient data structures and algorithms. Caching strategies reduce latency for frequent lookups, while batch processing optimizes throughput for bulk operations. The architecture supports horizontal scaling to handle growing attribution volume.</p>
                
                <h3>Impact on Marketing Effectiveness</h3>
                <p>The improved attribution system enables more accurate measurement of marketing campaign performance, leading to better budget allocation and campaign optimization. Enhanced deep link coverage improves user experience by directing users to relevant content within the app.</p>

                    <li><strong>Query result caching:</strong> Caching of expensive query results with intelligent invalidation based on data freshness requirements.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Worker Pool Architecture</h3>
                <p>The implementation of worker pool patterns optimized concurrent database operations. Connection pooling reduced connection overhead, while batch processing minimized the number of round trips to the database. Worker pools were sized based on database capacity and application requirements to maximize throughput without overwhelming the database.</p>
                
                <h3>Data Structure Optimization</h3>
                <p>Data structures were redesigned to minimize storage requirements and optimize access patterns. Sparse indexes were implemented for optional fields, and data compression techniques reduced storage costs. Schema design followed DynamoDB best practices for partition key distribution and sort key utilization.</p>
                
                <h3>Monitoring and Alerting</h3>
                <p>Comprehensive monitoring was implemented to track database performance metrics, cache hit rates, and cost trends. Grafana dashboards provide real-time visibility into system performance, while alerts notify operators of anomalous patterns that could indicate performance regressions.</p>
                
                <h3>Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>
                <p>The optimization efforts resulted in monthly savings of tens of thousands of rupees while maintaining system performance and reliability. The return on investment was immediate, with the reduced operational costs significantly outweighing the development effort required for optimization.</p>

                <h2>Future Work, Conclusions, and Learning Outcomes</h2>
                <p>This project successfully demonstrated the application of advanced software engineering, machine learning, and experimental design principles in a production environment, while identifying numerous opportunities for future enhancement.</p>
                
                <h3>Planned Future Enhancements</h3>
                <p>Several promising directions for future work have been identified:</p>
                
                <h4>User-specific Personalization</h4>
                <p>Advanced personalization incorporating individual browsing history, time-based preferences, and behavioral patterns will further improve content relevance. This includes developing user embeddings, implementing collaborative filtering, and creating dynamic user profiles that evolve with user behavior.</p>
                
                <h4>Multivariate Experimentation</h4>
                <p>Expanding beyond A/B testing to multivariate experiments will enable testing multiple variables simultaneously, leading to more efficient optimization. Automated winner selection algorithms will reduce manual intervention in experiment management and accelerate optimization cycles.</p>
                
                <h4>Real-time Deep Link Syncing</h4>
                <p>Implementing webhook-based real-time synchronization will eliminate delays in deep link updates and improve attribution accuracy. This system will process attribution events as they occur, providing immediate feedback for marketing optimization.</p>
                
                <h4>Cross-platform Expansion</h4>
                <p>Extending the system to additional verticals such as travel and groceries will validate the generalizability of the architecture and algorithms. This expansion will require vertical-specific customizations while maintaining the core system's flexibility and scalability.</p>
